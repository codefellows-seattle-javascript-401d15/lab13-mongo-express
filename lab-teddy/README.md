# Description:

### For this assignment we had to refactor our code to instead of using fs read and write file we start to use mongoose which made the amount of code that we are writing look cleaning and easier to use. I found that while doing it you had to use a specific route to use it. After figuring out how to use it makes things so much easier and simpler.

# Installation:

# Mongoose, bluebird, chai, chai-http, morgan, mocha, body-parser and express:

### Mongoose: `npm i -S mongoose` and inside of your file system you need to have a db file created to then run the code `mongod â€”dbpath ./db`.
### BlueBird: `npm i -S bluebird`.
### Body-Parser: `npm i -S body-parser`.
### Express: `npm i -S express`.
### Chai: `npm i -D chai`.
### Chai-Http: `npm i -D chai-http`.
### Morgan: `npm i -D morgan`.
### Mocha: `npm i -D mocha`.
